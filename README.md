This website was created for my Computer Science Programming Languages class, it is intended to show the skills with HTML,CSS,Javascript that I was able to learn during this period of time. 

#Website Presentation
For this website I chose a color theme of mostly greens and blues. I chose this color scheme because it thought that it would look nice on a website. I chose to make the navigation bar mostly red during mobile view so that it would stand out. I wanted to make the index screen a welcome screen that directs people to other parts of the website.

#Javascript

The main Javascript elements that used during creation of the website was DOM editing and buttons. I though that it would be interesting for project presentation for someone to click on a button and have text and images appear. This allows me to have multiple pieces that would normally take up the same amount of space. Unfortunatly this apporach of not really having to scroll resulting in my website basicly being a powerpoint presentation.
